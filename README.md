# Local Downloads
Steam users: Before trying a local download or reporting an issue, use [PeterHan's Mod Updater](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018291283)  \(recommended\) or [Ony's Mod Manager](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1843965353) to see if the mod is out of date.

Steam sometimes serves outdated mod versions, and Oxygen Not Included is also available on the Epic Games Store. Local copies of these mods are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/SanchozzDeponianin/ONIMods/releases) section, or you can just press `"Code" -> "Download ZIP"`. These mods should be installed into the `Local` folder, creating it if it does not already exist. Mods should remain in their own subfolder.

![Location where local mods should be installed](Docs/localmods.png)

+ Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\local` Replace the documents path with the path to your Documents folder if this folder has been redirected.
+ Mac OS: `/Users/user name/Library/Application Support/unity.Klei.Oxygen Not Included/mods/Local` Replace user name with your user name.
+ Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/mods/Local`

Note, the `Local` folder name is case-sensitive on Mac OS and Linux.

**Do not use a Steam copy and a local copy of the same mod at the same time.** Disable the Steam version in the mods list before activating any local copies.
